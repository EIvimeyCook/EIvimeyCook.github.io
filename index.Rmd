### Current

* Post-doctoral research associate at the University of East Anglia working with Prof. Alexei Maklakov and the nematode worm, *C. elegans*. 

**Project** – “The cost of longevity: trans-generational consequences of parental lifespan extension for offspring fitness”

\

### Past

* PhD at the University of Edinburgh with Dr Jacob Moorad and the burying beetle, *Nicrophorus vespilloides*.

**Thesis** – “Experimental and comparative analyses of maternal age and senescence”

\

### Research Interests

* I'm interested in understanding and investigating the huge diversity of ageing patterns that exists across the tree of life.

* My current work focuses on evolutionary theory, maternal senescence, inter-/trans-generational effects of parental age + diet, and thermal tolerance in beetles.
